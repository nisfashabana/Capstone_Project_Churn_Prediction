Telecom Churn Prediction

Developed a churn prediction model to identify customers at risk of leaving a telecom provider. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key churn drivers, including high monthly charges, short tenure, and contract type. Built and evaluated a Logistic Regression model achieving 81% accuracy. Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to visualize customer churn insights and support data-driven retention strategies.

Key Techniques & Tools:

•	EDA & Feature Engineering (Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

•	Churn Prediction Model (Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn)

•	Data Visualization (Power BI, Tableau, Excel)

•	Business Insights (Customer segmentation, retention strategies)
